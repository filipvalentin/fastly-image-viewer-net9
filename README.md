# Fastly Image Viewer .NET9
Fast and Simple open source image viewer written in .NET 9 WPF under the [GNU General Public License v2.0](https://github.com/Rebzzel/Fastly-Image-Viewer/blob/master/LICENSE)

Forked for the sole purpose of creating a quick-to-develop, lightweight, image viewer that can finally open HEIC images without paying 1$ to Microsoft.

I'll update more things in this repo as time goes by.

## To Do
 - [x] It works! Clunkily, but it works!
 - [ ] Rewrite the UI.
 - [ ] Expand zoom functionality 
 - [ ] Installer / portable folder
 - [ ] Improve performance / parallelize (The actual version seems slow)


Target platforms: Windows 7 and above
